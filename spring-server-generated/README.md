# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/v3 or http://localhost:8080/v3/swagger-ui
-   not sure what made this wrong - http://localhost:8080/  


Change default port value in application.properties

To make it work, i have made the following changes
1.  start working on StoreApi.java
    @RequestMapping(value = "/store/order/{orderId}",
    ...
    ResponseEntity<Order> getOrderById()

    a.  Do not have to do this - disable "application/xml" of content-type from StoreApi.java
     //produces = { "application/xml", "application/json" }, //Ln 72
        produces = { "application/json" }, 

2.  Customize the method in StoreApiController.java  - ResponseEntity<Order> getOrderById()
    a.  add a validation rule for 'x-lob: AMG' header
    b.  customize returns by various order id

3.  Testing cases
    a.  Good cases: both returning HTTP 'OK' 200
        i.  order id between 6 and 9 inclusively
        ii. order id = 5 and 'x-lob: AMG' header passed in 
    b.  Bad cases:  returning either 404 or 428
        i.  order id between 1 and 4 inclusively, returns HTTP 'NOT_FOUND' 404 .
        ii. order id greater than 9 , returns HTTP 'NOT_FOUND' 404 .
        iii.order id = 5 w/o 'x-lob: AMG' header passed in, returns HTTP 'PRECONDITION_REQUIRED' 428.
